Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to manage and provision infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, networks, and databases 
using a human-readable configuration file.
It supports a wide range of cloud and on-premises infrastructure providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more.

Terraform uses a declarative configuration language, called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), to define the desired state of your infrastructure.
You write configuration files that describe the resources you want to create, and Terraform takes care of creating and managing them for you.
